0x10. C-Variadic Functions

The following project works on C programming variadic functions, which are functions that take in any number of arguments as inputs.

0. Create a function that gets back the total of all its parameters.

	- Prototype: ***int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...)***

1. Create a function that produces numbers followed by a new line.

	- Prototype: ***void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...)***

2. Create a function that displays a sequence of characters, followed by a new line.

	- Prototype: ***void print_strings(const char *seperator, const unsigned int n, ...)***

3. Create a function that displays anything.

	- Prototype: ***void print_all(const char * const format, ...)***
